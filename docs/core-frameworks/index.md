# Core Frameworks

The Vibe Coding approach combines three powerful frameworks that work together to enhance AI-assisted development:

## Framework Overview

| Framework | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------------|
| [BMAD Method](./bmad-method) | Specialized AI personas for development | Throughout project lifecycle |
| [CursorRIPER](./cursor-riper) | Five-mode operational structure | For structured AI interactions |
| [vibe-tools](./vibe-tools) | CLI utility for AI assistance | Daily development tasks |

Each framework addresses different aspects of the AI-assisted development process, and they can be used together or independently based on your project needs.
