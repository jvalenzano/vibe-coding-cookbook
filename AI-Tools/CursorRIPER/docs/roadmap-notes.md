# CursorRIPER Framework Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

The CursorRIPER Framework provides a structured workflow for AI-assisted software development in Cursor IDE. It implements a systematic approach through five operational modes (Research, Innovate, Plan, Execute, Review) combined with a persistent memory system. RIPER was initially developed by [robotlovehuman](https://github.com/robotlovehuman)

## Current State Analysis

### Core Components
- **Framework Structure**: Core MDC files in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- **Workflow System**: RIPER modes with clear separation of responsibilities
- **Memory Bank**: Persistent documentation for project continuity
- **State Management**: Project phase and mode tracking
- **Initialization Process**: START phase for guided project setup
- **@ Symbol Integration**: Support for Cursor's context referencing system (New in Version 1.0.3, Branch: @Symbol-enhancement)

### Key Features
- Strict operational protocols to prevent unintended code modifications
- Persistent memory across sessions through Memory Bank files
- Mode-specific behavior enforcement
- Project phase management (Uninitiated, Initializing, Development, Maintenance)
- Comprehensive documentation system
- @ symbol registry for efficient context referencing
- Mode-specific @ symbol usage patterns
