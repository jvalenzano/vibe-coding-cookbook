🕵️‍♂️ Your browser commands are now like having DevTools on autopilot! Console logs and network activity captured by default:

```bash
vibe-tools browser act "Add pizza to cart" --url=pizzaplace.com
# Now automagically shows you all console logs and network calls! 
```

---

🔄 Browser sessions got that smooth jazz feel with improved page reuse:

```bash
vibe-tools browser act "Login" --url=myapp.com --connect-to=current
# Keeps your existing page state, no more starting fresh every time!
```

🤝 Introducing the ultimate AI power couple! Mix and match providers:

```bash
vibe-tools repo "Plan new feature" --fileProvider=openai --thinkingProvider=anthropic
# It's like having Batman AND Superman on your team

🤫 Sometimes you just want the answer without the chit-chat. New --quiet mode has got you covered:

```bash
vibe-tools web "what's 42 * 42?" --quiet
1764
# That's it. That's the tweet. 
```

📹 Lights, Camera, Automation! Record your browser sessions:

```bash
