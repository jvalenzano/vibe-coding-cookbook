# Feature Behavior: Parallel Test Execution

## Description
This test verifies that the test command can execute multiple scenarios in parallel, reducing overall test execution time.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast)
**Task Description:**
Use vibe-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly uses the vibe-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow)
**Task Description:**
Use vibe-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly uses the vibe-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast)
**Task Description:**
Use vibe-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly uses the vibe-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time
