# Feature Behavior: GitHub Integration Capability

## Description
vibe-tools should enable users to interact with GitHub repositories, including retrieving information about pull requests and issues. The github command and its subcommands (pr, issue) should provide detailed information about GitHub resources and handle authentication and error cases appropriately.
