# Feature Behavior: Implementation Planning Capability

## Description
vibe-tools should enable users to generate focused implementation plans for software development tasks. The plan command should leverage multiple AI models to identify relevant files, extract content, and generate detailed implementation plans. It should work with various provider combinations and handle different output formats.

## Test Scenarios

**Expected Behavior:**
- The command should fail with a clear error message
- Error message should mention that the specified thinkingProvider is invalid
- Error message should list available providers

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent recognizes the invalid thinkingProvider error
- Command fails gracefully with informative error message
- Error message includes suggestions for valid providers
- No partial or corrupted output is generated

### Scenario 7: Plan Generation with Invalid File Model (Error Handling)
**Task Description:**
Attempt to use vibe-tools to generate an implementation plan with a valid fileProvider (gemini | modelbox | openrouter) but an invalid fileModel (e.g. invalidModel).

**Expected Behavior:**
- The command should fail with a clear error message
- Error message should mention that the specified fileModel is invalid
- Error message should suggest valid models for the provider

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent recognizes the invalid fileModel error
- Command fails gracefully with informative error message
- Error message includes suggestions for valid models
- No partial or corrupted output is generated

### Scenario 8: Plan Generation with Invalid Thinking Model (Error Handling)
**Task Description:**
Attempt to use vibe-tools to generate an implementation plan with a valid thinkingProvider but an invalid thinkingModel.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The command should fail with a clear error message
- Error message should mention that the specified thinkingModel is invalid
- Error message should suggest valid models for the provider

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent recognizes the invalid thinkingModel error
- Command fails gracefully with informative error message
- Error message includes suggestions for valid models
- No partial or corrupted output is generated

### Scenario 9: Plan Generation in Empty Repository (Edge Case)
**Tags:** edge-case
**Task Description:**
Use vibe-tools to generate an implementation plan in an empty or nearly empty repository.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The command should handle the edge case gracefully
- The response should acknowledge the lack of existing code
- The plan should focus on creating new files and structure

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent successfully runs the plan command
- Response acknowledges the lack of existing code
- Plan suggests creating appropriate files and structure
- Command completes successfully without errors

### Scenario 10: Plan Generation with Missing API Keys (Error Handling)
**Task Description:**
Attempt to use vibe-tools to generate an implementation plan when API keys for the specified provider is missing. Test both a missing key for the fileProvider and a missing key for the thinkingProvider. To remove an API key use:
- CURSOR_TOOLS_ENV_UNSET=GEMINI_API_KEY vibe-tools <command> <args...>
or
- CURSOR_TOOLS_ENV_UNSET=OPENAI_API_KEY vibe-tools <command> <args...>

**Expected Behavior:**
- The command should fail with a clear error message
- Error message should mention the missing API keys
- Error message should provide guidance on how to configure the API keys

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent recognizes the missing API keys issue
- Command fails gracefully with informative error message
- Error message provides guidance on fixing the issue
- No partial or corrupted output is generated

### Scenario 11: Plan Generation with Invalid API Key (fallback)
**Task Description:**
Attempt to use vibe-tools to generate an implementation plan without specifying a provider when there are invalid API keys for the default provider. Test each ofL
- GEMINI_API_KEY=invalid_api_key vibe-tools <command> <args...>
and
- OPENAI_API_KEY=invalid_api_key vibe-tools <command> <args...>

**Expected Behavior:**
- The logs should include a clear error message indicating the API key that is invalid
- The logs should indicate that a fallback/alternate provider is being used
- The command should succeed using an alternate provider

**Success Criteria:**
- Command succeeds using an alternate provider
- The logs include a clear error message indicating the invalid API key
- The logs include a message indicating that a fallback/alternate provider is being used
- No partial or corrupted output is generated
- No API keys or security tokens are logged, not even invalid_api_key

### Scenario 12: Plan Generation with Custom Repomix Configuration (Happy Path)
**Tags:** repomix-config, configuration
**Task Description:**
Use vibe-tools to generate an implementation plan with a custom repomix.config.json file that modifies which files are included/excluded during the planning process.

First, create a repomix.config.json file using the content from {{path:plan-repomix-config.json}} in the repository root. Then, generate an implementation plan and observe if the configuration is respected.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The command should detect and use the custom repomix.config.json file
- The configuration should exclude files specified in the config from the file identification process
- The logs should indicate that the repomix config is being loaded from the local file
- The implementation plan should reflect that certain files are excluded from consideration

**Success Criteria:**
- Command output mentions loading repomix config from the local file
- Token count in the packed repository should be consistent with the configured exclusions
- The file identification phase should only find files that aren't excluded by the configuration
- The implementation plan should only reference files that aren't excluded by the configuration
- Command completes successfully without errors
- The configuration is properly applied during both file identification and content extraction phases
- The command output does not include unnecessarily verbose or debugging messages
- No API keys or security tokens are logged, not even invalid_api_key
