- The agent should perform sequential operations while maintaining state
- The state should be preserved between commands

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies how to connect to and reuse a browser session
- Second operation successfully uses the state from the first operation
- Commands complete successfully

### Scenario 8: Handling Missing Dependencies (Error Handling)
**Task Description:**
Attempt to use vibe-tools browser functionality when Playwright is not installed.

**Expected Behavior:**
