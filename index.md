## What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** is a collaborative approach where developers work alongside AI tools to create software more efficiently. Rather than writing every line of code manually, teams describe what they want to build in natural language, and AI tools help generate, refine, and implement the code.

## Our Integrated Framework

The Vibe Coding Cookbook combines three powerful tools:

- **BMAD METHOD** - Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development
- **CursorRIPER** - Research, Innovate, Plan, Execute, Review framework
- **Vibe-Tools Framework** - CLI utility for enhancing AI-assisted development

## Quick Start

Get started with Vibe Coding in three easy steps:

1. **Set up your environment**
2. **Initialize a new project**
3. **Start collaborating with AI**
